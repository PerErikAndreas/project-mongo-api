# Project Mongo API

This week we were doing a MongoDB project

## The problem

I started this project by coding with codecoach Daniel for seting up the basics for MongoDb and Mongoose. Then I added the endpoints that was filtered for each purpose. After that me and Ajmal started the process of deploying to google cloud and setting up the database/json in cloudMongoDB.
